# iTerm2 save it's preference in ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist in a binary format
# What you need to do is basically copy that somewhere, convert to xml and remove color schemes in the xml files.

# to make it easier, record a macro in vi to remove the key (e.g: Desert/Solarized) using `dd`,
# and then remove its color dict with `dat` (delete around tag), and repeat the macro until
# all color schemes you want to delete is gone.
